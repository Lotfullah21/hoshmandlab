            Girls and boys has been under immmense pressure from Taliban
            sida,especially Girls who had lost most of their rights, now,
            coiming to the pre taliban, even thoug, we had schools opened both
            for girls and boys, but not connected to the outside world was a big
            problem in itself, Here, seeing the recent breakthroughs in the stem
            field, especially Information and technology, and observing the fact
            we have had not clue about how does these things build from software
            and hardware side, we want to bridge this gaps and give them the
            knowledge so that themselves can experience how thins work, and we
            can build them too.

            for the Afghan girls who are studying up to 7th grade, but facing an
            unknown future, it looks scary when i think about them, and painful
            as well, it bites my heart, how on earth we can do this to them,they
            are going to school just for the sake of going, because when it is
            the their blossom season to become another Ada Lovalace, another
            Mari Curi, they cannot be. We took their dreams away.

            Thinking about next season,just as their brothers are getting ready
            for school, they too. Buying new clothes, pen and papers, but what,
            they cannot enter to the school where they had been there for long
            time, made dreams about their future, being a doctor, an engineer, a
            teacher, a physicists, but NO, they cannot, we took all of their
            dreams away from them.
