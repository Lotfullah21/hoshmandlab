          <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

          <p>
            it all started with the vision of john von neuman American
            Scientist, where he envisioned about intelligence, then it came to
            Frank Rosenblat to take his chance, but due to lack of computation
            could not do much, but by getting better in computation part,
            visionary Hinton started to work on the topic,from 1980s, he had his
            own company of GPUs,the current wave of AI started basically from
            Canada by Hinton and Yoshua Bengion, lets not forget MIT Scientists.

          <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>
            Machine learning which statisticians are calling it statistical
            learning, we are not entering their battle. Machine learning is
            tries to find pattern in the data and use that as a learning
            mechanism to solve later similar task, it does this without being
            directly programmed to do so,in tradational computer science, in
            order to do something, we tell computer exactly what to do, but here
            the case is otherwise,<em>How it learns</em>? we define a learning
            algorithm which based on that it can learn from the mistakes it
            makes during learning process, with every mismatch between our
            answers and what the machine predicts there will be a punishment,
            based on that punishment the machine learns that it made a big
            mistake, and next time it tries to improve by making adjustment to
            they attributes or parameters which had effect on the previous
            prediction.

          <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
          <p>
            keep statistical learning aside, why do not mimic the brain?
            Okay,this is what we are doing here.we use from tiny tiny
            computation units which are called <b>Neurons</b>, Neurons are the
            main computation power in human brains,and we need lots of them to
            make decision, or in another words few million neurons decide that
            outsiide is raining, go later, in fact this computation is done in
            brain using neurons which are connected through tiny wires which are
            called synopsis, Now we will make the same kind of computation unit
            make our models learn, as of now, it had been proven that it works
            best in all area of Artificial Intelligence.

          <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
          <p>
            it is all about how we learn in the environment by doing some and
            get rewards, do that work better with more precision, get higher
            rewards. the Scientists and Engineers try to build robots and make
            them learn using Reinforcement learning techniques.
